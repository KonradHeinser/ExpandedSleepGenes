Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) is the step beyond [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url]. Where that series sought to expand ranges that already exist, this series seeks to add ranges that should exist. You get gene ranges that alter sleep fall rate, but why not a range for changing the rate it recovers? If you can have fire resistance genes, why not have genes to resist other types of damage like frostbite and acid?

This mod will solve the sleep problem by giving you some new sleep genes. Specifically, it gives 12 new genes that alter the rest rate multiplier. The rate multipliers are 0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.55, 0.7, 0.85, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, and 2.2.

This mod also adds two genes for forcing a xenotype to be nocturnal or diurnal. This is accomplished by either forcing or suppressing the night owl gene. Which brings me to the fun fact of the day. There is actually evidence that genetics can influence the day-night cycle of various species on earth. While factors like age and lifestyle tend to be more common factors, there are some instances where a genetic mutation can cause certain individuals to not be bound by the diurnality that most humans have. I just wanted to learn about night owls, but it seems genetics are just a part of me.


This mod will eventually be put into Expanded Biotech Style Genes - All in One. If that mod exists and you still see this message, please let me know I forgot to add the link here.
